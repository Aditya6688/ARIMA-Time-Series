ARIMA Time Series Forecasting
Overview
This repository provides an implementation of time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The project is designed to forecast future values of a time series based on historical data, offering insights into trends and seasonal patterns.

Features
Preprocessing and visualization of time series data.
Implementation of ARIMA for univariate time series forecasting.
Automatic determination of optimal ARIMA parameters using grid search or AIC/BIC criteria.
Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Plotting of forecasted results alongside actual data.
